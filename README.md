# Cloud-Security-Source-Codes

This project provides a Python code example for managing cloud security for your AWS resources. It includes code snippets for data encryption before uploading to cloud, access control management for cloud resources, and vulnerability scanning for your EC2 instances using the OpenSCAP Python API.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed
- OpenSCAP Python API installed

## Usage

The code snippets in this project can be used to improve the security of your AWS resources by:

### 01: Data Encryption before uploading to Cloud

This code snippet provides a function to encrypt data before uploading it to Amazon S3. The function uses AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode to encrypt the data with a randomly generated initialization vector (IV) and a key. The key is read from a file specified by the user.

To use this function, call `upload_encrypted_data_to_s3(bucket, key, data, keyfile)` where `bucket` is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket, `key` is the object key, `data` is the data to be encrypted, and `keyfile` is the path to the file containing the key.

### 02: Access Controls Management for Cloud Resources (AWS SDK)

This code snippet provides functions to grant and revoke bucket access for a user using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and to create an IAM user.

To grant access to a bucket for a user, call `grant_bucket_access_to_user(bucket, user)` where `bucket` is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket and `user` is the username of the IAM user.

To revoke access to a bucket for a user, call `revoke_bucket_access_for_user(bucket, user)` where `bucket` is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket and `user` is the username of the IAM user.

To create an IAM user, call `create_iam_user(username)` where `username` is the desired username for the IAM user.

### 03: Cloud Resources for Vulnerabilities (OpenSCAP Python API)

This code snippet provides a function to scan an EC2 instance for vulnerabilities using the OpenSCAP Python API. The function takes an instance ID as input, retrieves the instance's public IP address, and uses the OpenSCAP Python API to scan the instance for vulnerabilities using the PCI-DSS policy.

To scan an EC2 instance for vulnerabilities, call `scan_ec2_instance_for_vulnerabilities(instance_id)` where `instance_id` is the ID of the EC2 instance.

## Conclusion

The Python code examples provided in this project demonstrate how to improve the security of your AWS resources by encrypting data before uploading it to cloud, managing access controls for cloud resources, and scanning EC2 instances for vulnerabilities.
